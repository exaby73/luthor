## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── docs/
│   │   └── config.ts
│   ├── icons/
│   ├── schemas/
│   ├── styles/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── env.d.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

Any component overrides made by this theme can be found in `src/components/`, any icons are located in `src/icons/`, and all styles are
in the `src/styles/` directory.

To find out more, start your development server and check out the **Features** page.
