## Installation

Luthor can be installed into any Dart project using the following command:

```bash
dart pub add luthor
```

If you're using Flutter, you can also use the following command:

```bash
flutter pub add luthor
```

#### Installing Code Generation Packages

Luthor can be used with code generation using `build_runner` optionally. To use code generation, you need to add the following dependencies as well:

```bash
dart pub add luthor_annotation dev:build_runner dev:luthor_generator
```

If you're using Flutter, you can also use the following command:

```bash
flutter pub add luthor_annotation dev:build_runner dev:luthor_generator
```

And you're all set! You can now start using Luthor in your project.
